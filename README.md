# Elypso engine

Elypso engine is a game development engine made with OpenGL and C++ 20. It is currently in the prototype phase and is not yet functional enough to make games with.

The main branch holds a stable version of the engine that is up to date with the latest Release version, the indev branch is an unstable version of the next engine version and is unsafe to use in production.

Everything is still in early development and is highly likely to be modified a lot before alpha is released so there is no documentation provided at the current stage. Alpha is aimed for march/april 2024 and will include a bare-bones structure for making very basic games and the engine will significantly improve during alpha. Beta will release at the beginning of 2025 and is aimed to be worked on for the entirety of 2025 so the full release of this engine is aimed for the start of 2026.

The engine folder README.md file contains instructions how to compile the engine from source and what files are used for what purposes and some extra details.

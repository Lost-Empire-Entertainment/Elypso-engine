# Elypso engine

**Elypso Engine** is a game development engine that is made with OpenGL, C++ 20 and [several libraries](https://github.com/Lost-Empire-Entertainment/Elypso-engine/blob/main/LIBRARIES.md) and it runs natively on Windows and Linux.

The engine is currently in the Alpha stage and has finished all of its Prototype versions.
- Elypso Engine beta release date is aimed for winter 2025.
- Elypso Engine full release date is aimed for winter 2026.

These dates are not final and may change so check back here regularly to see updates.

The documentation for **Elypso Hub**, **Elypso Engine**, **Game Template** and the **Compiler** will be found at the [website](https://elypsoengine.com) so please look there for information, this README file will not cover how to install or use them.

### Prerequisites

To compile **Elypso Hub**, **Elypso Engine**, **Game Template**, or the **Compiler** from their source code, it is recommended to have the following tools installed:

- **CMake**
- **Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition** (or another edition of Visual Studio 2022)

If you prefer to compile with a different setup, you will need to provide your own compiler and IDE. By default, the engine compiles the game using **CMake** and **MSVC** (Visual Studio 2022). If you choose to use another IDE or compiler, you will need to modify the `RunInstaller` function in the game compiler script, located at: `Engine/src/engine/core/compile.cpp`.

For those who want to use **CMake** and **Visual Studio 2022**, detailed setup instructions are provided:

- **CMake Setup**: [Download 'Windows x64 installer here' here](https://cmake.org/download/). Setup instructions are available in `_external_shared/CMake/setup.txt`.
- **Visual Studio Setup**: [Download preferred version here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Setup instructions are available in `_external_shared/Visual_Studio/setup.txt`.

### False positives from Windows Security

If this is your first time running the program then Windows may throw false positives like trojan or other "security threats". Follow [this Microsoft tutorial](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26) to exclude **Elypso Hub**, **Elypso Engine**, **Game Template** and the **Compiler** folders from Windows Security scans.

### Discord Game SDK and Rich Presence

By default **Elypso Engine** and its **Game Template** will not include **Discord Game SDK** because Discord does not allow to distribute it, if you wish to use it in your game or in the engine then follow the instructions in `_external_shared/Discord/setup.txt`.

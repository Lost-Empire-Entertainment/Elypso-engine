# **Elypso engine** is in early alpha development. This branch is in early development and is not ready for use. Use the 'main' branch if you want a stable version of the old engine codebase, this branch will replace main and indev once its ready for use.

**Elypso engine** is an OpenGL C++ 20 game development engine and it uses several libraries listed in [the library file](LIBRARIES.md).

All changes will be listed at the [trello page](https://trello.com/b/hbt6ebCZ/elypso-engine) for each engine version, look at the pre-release task cards to see details for each pre-release.

The documentation for **Elypso engine** will be found at the [official website](https://elypsoengine.com) in the near future so please look there for information, this README file will not cover how to install or use this program.

[Elypso hub](https://github.com/Lost-Empire-Entertainment/Elypso-hub) is not included in this repository, it is required for normal engine operation, but the [releases](https://github.com/Lost-Empire-Entertainment/Elypso-engine/releases) provide it in its latest functioning format. So if you want to compile from source you have to also download Elypso Hub from its own repository.

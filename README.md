# Elypso engine

![Engine screenshot](image.png)

**Elypso engine** is an OpenGL C++ 20 game development engine. It runs natively on Windows and Linux (tested on Ubuntu-based distros and Arch) and it uses several libraries listed in [the library file](LIBRARIES.md).

**Elypso engine** is in early alpha development and will be heavily modified during alpha development. Beta is aimed for winter 2025, full release is aimed for winter 2026.

The documentation for **Elypso engine** will be found at the [website](https://elypsoengine.com)  in the near future so please look there for information, this README file will not cover how to install or use this program.

If you intend to download the source code and compile from source then please also download [Elypso hub](https://github.com/Lost-Empire-Entertainment/Elypso-hub)
 and [Elypso compiler](https://github.com/Lost-Empire-Entertainment/Elypso-compiler), they are not included in this repository. Once they are downloaded make sure they are all under the same parent folder or else they may not compile correctly.

The release version already has Hub, Engine and Game folders, you do not need to download Hub or Compiler, the Compiler is only used for compiling Hub, Engine and Engine library from source and the Release version already provides functional 0.1.2 and previous versions of the Hub, Engine and Game that are ready for use out of the box with all the required prerequisite information.

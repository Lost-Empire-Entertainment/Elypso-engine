# KalaHeaders

Header-only scripts made in C++ 20, great for general use. They don't depend on each other and can be used for any c++ projects.

## file_utils.hpp

Provides file management, file metadata, text I/O and binary I/O helper functions

### File management

| Function              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| CreateFile            | Create regular or binary file at target path. If you also want data written to the new file after its been created then pass a fileData struct with one of the fields filled in, only the first found field data is used |
| CreateDirectory       | Create a directory at target path, this also creates all parent folders up to it that don't exist yet |
| ListDirectoryContents | List all the contents of a folder, with optional recursive flag |
| RenamePath            | Rename file or folder in its current directory |
| DeletePath            | Delete file or folder in target path (recursive for directories) |
| CopyPath              | Copy file or folder from origin to target, with optional overwrite flag |
| MovePath              | Move file or folder from origin to target, target is always overwritten if it already exists |

### File metadata

| Function              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| GetFileSize           | Get the size of the target file in bytes |
| GetDirectorySize      | Get the size of the target directory in bytes |
| GetTextFileLineCount  | Get the count of lines in a text file |
| GetPathName           | Get the filename of the target (with extension) |
| GetPathStem           | Get the stem (filename without extension) of the target |
| GetPathParent         | Get the parent directory of the target |
| SetPathExtension      | Set the extension of the target |
| GetPathExtension      | Get the extension of the target |

### Text I/O

| Function              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| WriteTextToFile       | Write all text from a string to a text file, with optional append flag. A new file is created at target path if it doesn't already exist |
| ReadTextFromFile      | Read all text from a file into a string |
| WriteLinesToFile      | Write all lines from a vector to a text file, with optional append flag. A new file is created at target path if it doesn't already exist |
| ReadLinesFromFile     | Read all lines from a file into a vector of strings with optional lineStart and lineEnd values to avoid placing all lines to memory. If lineEnd is 0 and lineStart isnt, then this function defaults end to EOF |

### Binary I/O

| Function              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| WriteBinaryBufferToFile      | Write raw binary buffer (pointer + size) to a file, with optional append flag. A new file is created at target path if it doesn't already exist |
| ReadBinaryBufferFromFile     | Read raw binary data from a file into a buffer (up to bufferSize bytes). OutBytesRead returns the number of bytes read |
| WriteBinaryLinesToFile       | Write all binary data from a vector<uint8_t> to a file, with optional append flag. A new file is created at target path if it doesn't already exist |
| ReadBinaryLinesFromFile      | Read all binary data from a file into a vector<uint8_t> with optional rangeStart and rangeEnd values to avoid placing whole binary file to memory. If rangeEnd is 0 and rangeStart isnt, then this function defaults end to EOF |

## log_utils.hpp

Comprehensive logger header for any logging needs - sends cout, cerr and clog messages to your console.

- can get current system time and date, formatted to chosen TimeFormat or DateFormat enum choice
- can set default time and date format so that TIME_DEFAULT and DATE_DEFAULT always use them with full Print function
- has full and basic Print functions

## Full and basic Print function differences

| Feature           | `Print(message, target, type, ...)` | `Print(message)`        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Parameters        | Message + target + log type (+opts)           | Message only            |
| Log types         | Supports INFO, DEBUG, SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR | Not supported (always cout) |
| Target handling   | Yes (with truncation checks)                  | No                      |
| Time/Date stamp   | Yes (configurable)                            | No                      |
| Output stream     | Varies by type (cout/clog/cerr)               | Always cout             |
| Truncation checks | Message + target length                       | Message length only     |
| Typical usage     | Detailed, tagged log for debugging/monitoring | Quick, simple console output |

Instructions for Setting up CMake for Elypso Hub, Elypso Engine, Game Template, and Compiler
Version: 1.0

Steps:

1. Run the installer (e.g., `cmake-3.30.4-windows-x86_64.msi`â€”the version may vary).
2. On the first page, click `Next`. On the second page, check the box to accept the license agreement, and click `Next` again.
3. On the following page, you will see two options. Make sure to check the first box labeled `Add CMake to the PATH for all users`. None of the programs will compile without this enabled. Then, click `Next` twice, and finally, click `Install`.
4. Wait for the installation to complete, and click `Finish` to finalize the setup.

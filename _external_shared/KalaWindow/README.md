# KalaWindow

**KalaWindow** is a C++20 window library for Windows and Linux, it is used for making software and games.

**KalaWindow** creates and owns the OpenGL 3.3 and Vulkan 1.3 context, manages the message loop, handles crashes safely through the crash handler and handles all inputs through the input framework. **KalaWindow** owns the GL and VK functions so Glad or other similar ones are not needed.

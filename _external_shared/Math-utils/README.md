This is a simple header-only math library that handles commonly used math functions. example.cpp and example.hpp are there to show how to use the math.hpp header file, they are not required to use the math header file.

Note: All outputs except Equals, LessThan and GreaterThan default to long double for high precision.

The following functions are provided:

	- Add: Adds B to A.
	- Subtract: Subtracts B from A.
	- Multiply: Multiplies B by A.
	- Divide: Divides B by A.
	- Mod: Finds the remainder of A divided by B.
	- Power: Raises A to the power of B.
	- Sqrt: Calculates the square root of A.
	- Abs: Returns the absolute value of A.
	- Max: Determines the maximum of A and B.
	- Min: Determines the minimum of A and B.
	- Equals: Checks if A is equal to B.
	- LessThan: Checks if A is less than B.
	- GreaterThan: Checks if A is greater than B.
	- Percentage: Determines the percentage of A relative to B.
	- Clamp: Constrains a value within the range of min and max.
	- Lerp: Interpolates linearly between A and B based on T.
	- Ceil: Rounds A up to the nearest integer that is greater than or equal to A.
	- Round: Rounds A down to the nearest integer if A is less than halfway to the next integer; otherwise, rounds up.
	- Floor: Rounds A down to the nearest integer that is less than or equal to A.
	- Sine: Computes the sine of an angle.
	- Cosine: Computes the cosine of an angle.
	- Tan: Computes the tangent of an angle.
	- DegToRad: Converts degrees to radians.
	- RadToDeg: Converts radians to degrees.

**Elypso Physics** is a lightweight **C++ 20** physics library that utilizes **GLM** for core mathematical operations while maintaining compatibility with any graphics API, not just **OpenGL**.

Designed to be **platform-agnostic**, the library aims for full compatibility with **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**, though it has only been tested on **Windows** and **Ubuntu** distributions. Relying solely on standard **C++ 20** libraries and **GLM**, it ensures seamless **cross-platform support**.

Currently in **VERY early development**, the library is **unstable** and subject to significant changes. However, **basic AABB collision detection** is already functional.

Full documentation will be available on the [official website](https://www.elypsoengine.com) in the near future. Please refer there for **installation** and **usage instructions**, as this **README** does not cover those details.

Instructions for Setting up Discord Game SDK and Rich Presence for Elypso Engine and Game Template
Version: 1.0

Reminder: The Discord Game SDK files are only meant to be used in closed-source projects. You are not allowed to redistribute the Discord Game SDK files in any open-source repositories.

Steps:

1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal: https://discord.com/developers/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk
2. Download 'Discord Game SDK v3.2.1'.
3. Extract the contents of the Discord Game SDK zip file into the `_external_shared/Discord` folder.
4. Inside the Discord folder, create two new subfolders: `src` and `include`.
5. Copy all `.h` files from both the `c` and `cpp` directories in the SDK into the `include` folder.
6. Copy all `.cpp` files from the `cpp` directory into the `src` folder.
7. Copy `discord_game_sdk.dll` and `discord_game_sdk.dll.lib` from the `lib` directory into the `Discord` folder.
8. Delete all unnecessary files and folders in the Discord folder except for `src`, `include`, `discord_game_sdk.dll.lib`, and `discord_game_sdk.dll`.
9. Copy `discord_game_sdk.dll` to:
    - `Engine/files/external dlls`
    - `Game/files/external dlls`
10. Open `CMakeLists.txt` and:
    - Uncomment the Discord-related lines.
    - Replace `remove` with `add` for both the Engine, Engine library, and Game sections.
11. Perform a clean rebuild of the Engine and Engine library using your compiler, followed by a clean rebuild of your game in the engine.

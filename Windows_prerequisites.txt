HOW TO SET UP NECESSARY THINGS TO RUN ENGINE NATIVELY ON WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. unpack prerequisites.7z
2. run setup.bat

NOTE: You are REQUIRED to use Visual Studio 2022 or newer, ninja and cmake if you wish to use the hub, compiler, engine, engine library and game with the provided setup on Windows 10 and 11. The programs are built to use those from the ground up, if you wish to use something else then you have to modify the files yourself. Lost Empire Entertainment does not distribute Visual Studio 2022, you need to download that manually yourself.

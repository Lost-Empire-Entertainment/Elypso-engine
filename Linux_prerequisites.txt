===========================================================================
THESE COMMANDS SHOULD ALWAYS BE RAN BEFORE RUNNING 
ANY OF THE ELYPSO PROGRAMS FOR THE FIRST TIME
===========================================================================

--- SYSTEM SETUP ---
sudo apt update                         # Update the package list
sudo apt upgrade -y                     # Upgrade all installed packages
sudo apt install -y build-essential     # Essential build tools (compilers, linkers, etc.)
sudo apt install -y gdb                 # GNU Debugger (GDB) for debugging applications
sudo apt install -y cmake               # CMake, a build system and project management tool

--- ASSET HANDLING AND GUI UTILITIES ---
sudo apt install -y libassimp-dev       # Assimp (Open Asset Import Library for 3D model loading)
sudo apt install -y zenity              # Zenity (for GUI dialogs in shell scripts)

===========================================================================
IF NONE OF THE ELYPSO PROGRAMS DONT RUN, TRY THESE COMMANDS
===========================================================================

--- GRAPHICS DRIVERS (Choose based on your GPU) ---
### Check GPU Vendor (Run this command to identify your GPU)
lspci | grep -E "VGA|3D"

### NVIDIA Drivers (For GeForce, RTX, GTX GPUs)
sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver-535   # Install NVIDIA driver (replace 535 with the latest available version)
sudo apt install -y nvidia-utils-535    # NVIDIA utilities (for GPU management)
sudo apt install -y libnvidia-egl-wayland1  # NVIDIA Wayland support (required for Wayland sessions)

### AMD/Intel Drivers (For Radeon GPUs/Intel Integrated Graphics - Mesa)
sudo apt install -y libgl1-mesa-dev     # Mesa OpenGL development libraries
sudo apt install -y libglu1-mesa-dev    # Mesa GLU development libraries (for higher-level OpenGL utilities)

--- X11 AND WAYLAND WINDOW MANAGEMENT LIBRARIES ---
### X11 Libraries (For Traditional Xorg Support - Only Needed for X11)
sudo apt install -y libx11-dev          # X11 core development libraries (basic windowing)
sudo apt install -y libxrandr-dev       # XRandR (for screen resolution and refresh rate control)

### Wayland Libraries (For Modern Display Protocols - Only Needed for Wayland)
sudo apt install -y libwayland-dev      # Wayland core development library
sudo apt install -y libegl1-mesa-dev    # EGL library (Required for both X11 and Wayland OpenGL rendering)
sudo apt install -y libgles2-mesa-dev   # OpenGL ES 2.0 development libraries (Required for both X11 and Wayland)
sudo apt install -y libwayland-egl1     # Wayland EGL integration (Required if running OpenGL apps on Wayland)
sudo apt install -y xwayland            # For running X11 applications on Wayland

--- GRAPHICS LIBRARIES (For OpenGL and Rendering) ---
sudo apt install -y libglfw3-dev        # GLFW (an OpenGL windowing library, works on both X11 and Wayland)
